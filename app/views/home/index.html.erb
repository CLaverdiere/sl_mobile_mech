  <h1>Welcome to SL Mobile Mechanic</h1>
  <p>Imagine this. You're sitting in the waiting room at a repair shop,
  wondering how much it's going to cost to fix your car. Any minute now, a
  shop employee's going to slap you with the bill, along with annoying
  financing and credit card offers. We've all been there.</p>

  <p>Who can help you avoid this mess? That's who I am. I've been fixing
  all makes of cars for over 13 years, am <em>ASE certified</em>, and a
  former <em>MD state inspector.</em></p>

  <p>After years working at dealer and repair shops, I saw a need for
  quality mobile service, not just jump-starts and lockouts. I started my
  business to cultivate my love of fixing cars, and match it with my love
  of helping people through good customer relationships. </p>

  <p>I'm Scott Laverdiere, your mobile mechanic.</p>
